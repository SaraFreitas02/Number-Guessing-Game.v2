# Number Guessing Game (.v2)

## Description
This is a simple *Number Guessing Game* where users attempt to match their guess with a computer-generated number. Depending on the selected difficulty level, players may need to guess a number between *1 and 10*, *1 and 25*, or *1 and 50*.

Different feedback will be given throughout the game, including the loss of lives, accumulation of points, and more.

## Origins and Evolution
This project initially began as an opportunity to practice jQuery. I decided to take the basic and straightforward [JavaScript version](https://github.com/SaraFreitas02/NumGuessGame.js-practice) of this game and elevate it, hence the "*v2*" in the project's name.

My goal was to make the game more engaging and dynamic, and this journey allowed me to explore CSS animations for the first time.

The result is a game that, despite its simplicity, is both addictive and visually captivating.

## How to use
### 1. Access the game
To access the game, open the `index.html` file in your browser engine or click [here](https://sarafreitas02.github.io/Number-Guessing-Game.v2/).

### 2. Choose difficulty level
When the game loads, it will show the game's name along with three buttons, each representing a different difficulty level:

- **Easy:** Guess numbers from *1 to 10.*
- **Medium:** Guess numbers from *1 to 25.*
- **Hard:** Guess numbers from *1 to 50.*

### 3. Make your guess
Once you've chosen a difficulty level, the page will transform. It will feature an empty input field and a button labeled "Guess." Additionally, you'll find 10 hearts and a points display.

- To participate, simply enter your guess into the field and click the "Guess" button.
  
- The game will promptly inform you whether your guess was correct or not.

### 4. Get it right or get it wrong
If you correctly guess a number, you'll earn a specific number of points based on the difficulty level you selected at the beginning:

- **Easy:** You'll receive *10 points* for each correct guess.
- **Medium:** You'll earn *20 points* for each correct guess.
- **Hard:** You'll gain *30 points* for each correct guess.

Your points will accumulate throughout the game.

However, if you make an incorrect guess, you'll **lose a heart** (life). You start with a total of 10 lives.

### 5. Game Over... Play again
If you **run out of lives**, the game will come to an end, and a *'Game Over'* page will appear. Here, you can view the total number of points you earned during the round.

To start a new game, simply **click the *'Play Again'*** button displayed on the *'Game Over'* page. This will take you back to the beginning, where you can once again choose a difficulty level.

## Features

- Alert messages to let you know if your input is valid.
- Various changes of content without changing the page.
